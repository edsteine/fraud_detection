## API Integration

The app communicates with a backend built using Django and a machine learning model for fraud detection. You can configure the API endpoints in `api_service.dart`.

Make sure to provide your API base URL in the `constants.dart` file:
```dart
const String apiUrl = 'https://your-api-url.com';
```

## Running Tests

Run unit tests using the following command:
```bash
flutter test
```

## Dependencies

- **Flutter SDK**
- **Provider**: State management
- **http**: For making HTTP requests to the backend
- **Flutter Secure Storage**: Securely store user credentials
